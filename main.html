	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  <p>When we discuss the efficiency of an algorithm, we often refer to its time complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the size of its input. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) will take time linearly proportional to the size of its input.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, space complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of the size of its input. For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) will use a memory space linearly proportional to the size of its input. It's important to note that space complexity is not always directly related to the efficiency of an algorithm. For example, an algorithm that uses a lot of memory space but executes very quickly may still be considered efficient in terms of time complexity.</p>
